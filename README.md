🛠️ Python Projects (Highlights)

This repository showcases a few beginner-to-intermediate Python projects designed to reinforce core programming concepts such as control flow, randomization, modular functions, and CLI interaction. Each project is self-contained and demonstrates logic-building through games or simulations.

🔹 Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

A creative command-line game using condition trees, modular functions, and randomness to handle 5-choice logic. This variation expands the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors by adding Lizard and Spock, popularized by pop culture.

Key Concepts:
	•	Conditional logic trees
	•	Modular function design
	•	Randomized computer choice
	•	Clean CLI feedback

⸻

🔹 Rock Paper Scissors vs Computer

A simple Python game where a human plays against the computer. Built with loops, random, and logic evaluation to determine round outcomes.

Key Concepts:
	•	Loops and control flow
	•	User input handling
	•	Result comparison
	•	Random choice generation

⸻

🎲 6-Sided Dice Simulator

A compact simulation of a standard six-sided dice roll. Designed to practice modular code structure, randomization, and clean user input/output interaction.

Key Concepts:
	•	Use of the random module
	•	Modular design (functions)
	•	Input/output management
	•	Replay loop structure
